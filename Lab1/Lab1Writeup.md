Neither seemed to be packed or obfuscated.

4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports
are they?

The malware seems to steal some files and exports them through the dll. 

5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?

I could look in the C:/* directory in strings, as well as the kerne132.exe which is trying to blend in with kernel32.exe

6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on
infected machines?

There is an IP address in the strings as well as sockets being opened which tells me it is calling back to something.

7. What would you guess is the purpose of these 

This malware is a command and control due to having sockets being opened and reaching out to an IP. Exe is used to run dll due to using create processes and sleep which is used for backdoors
